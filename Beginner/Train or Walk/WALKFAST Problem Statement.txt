Chefland has all the cities on a straight line. There are N cities in Chefland numbered 1 to N. City i is located at coordinate xi on the x-axis. Guru wants to travel from city A to city B. He starts at time t=0. He has following choices to travel.

He can walk 1 metre in P secs.
There is a train that travels from city C to city D which travels 1 metre in Q secs which starts at time t=Y secs. Guru can take the train only at city C and leave the train only at city D.
Can you help Guru find the minimum time he will need to travel from city A to B. Note that you cannot board the train after time t =Y.

Input:
First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
First line of each testcase contains eight space separated integers N,A,B,C,D,P,Q,Y.
Second line of each testcase contains N space-separated integers with the i-th integer representing xi.
Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line containing the minimum travel time.

Constraints

2≤N≤300
−1000≤xi≤1000
0≤Y≤100000
1≤A,B,C,D≤n
A≠B

4 1 3 2 4 3 2 4

1 2 3 4

Sample Output:
6

EXPLANATION:
Guru can walk directly in 6 secs.
